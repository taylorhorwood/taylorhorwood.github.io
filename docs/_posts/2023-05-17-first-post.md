Digital Engineering, BIM, ISO 19650. Firms use these buzzwords to promise fundamental change and cost benefits to clients. Companies claim digital tools will bring from their normal business practices to the gross margins of Google. Digital tools such as BIM, AI, Python convince managers that they are no longer construction contractors and/or civil engineers but tech executives.

Most of these tools were released in the 1990s and have been used by frontline engineers for years. Digital engineering isn't a couple of tools, programs, 3D models that firms can adopt but development mindset that aligns traditional AEC with development methodogies adopted by FANG businesses.
