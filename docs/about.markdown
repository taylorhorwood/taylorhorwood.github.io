I work as a digital engineering manager for a transmission and industrial electrical (HV) contractor. Primary experience is with engenering and construction analytics especially around electrical infrastructure. I also manage the analytics and innovation for the New Zealand business.
I'm intrested in open source tools and open data sets especially when it applies to heavy infrastructure.

Intrests:
- OSS
- Rust
- Construction and BIM
- Connecting datasets together

Inspirations:
- RTE 
- LF Energy
- EPRI (kinda)
- buildingSmart
- Microsoft (despite below)

Things that annoy me:
- Propriety file formats that make me use cloud servers to access my data
- Gatekeeping
- Excel (despite using it every day)
- Power BI (the worlds biggest hack that works)
